## Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our program supports equitable use by providing modern and 
simplified GUI that is easy to is easy to understand for all users, 
regardless of their familiarity with technology.  The design provides the same 
interface and functionality for everyone. interface and functionality 
for everyone. Future enhancements, such as language and unit change options 
and a dark/light theme mode, could further expand accessibility and appeal to 
an even broader audience.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Our program allows users to interact at their own pace with no time-sensitive 
inputs. Input fields, like those in the Checker feature, are simple text boxes for 
ease of use. To enhance accessibility, we could add text-to-speech functionality or 
compatibility with braille devices, ensuring inclusivity for users with disabilities.


## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Our program allows users to interact at their own pace with no time-sensitive inputs. 
Input fields, like those in the Checker feature, are simple text boxes for ease of use. 
In the future, we would like to implement more accuracy and precision by adding drop-down 
menus and selection boxes to features such as selecting a city.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
This principle focuses on an accessible UI to all users that conveys all necessary 
information regardless of the user’s limitations. One of our program’s strengths is 
its “legibility,” as our GUI provides an adequate contrast between the essential 
information, allowing for easy navigation. We can also consider the following additions: 
a text-to-speech and/or speech-to-text feature, a tutorial or navigation feature, 
and to add more images and/or maps.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error


## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program adheres to the principle of Size and Space 
for Approach and Use by selecting a font style and size that 
ensure readability, making it accessible to users with varying 
levels of vision or experience. Furthermore, the interface incorporates 
sufficient spacing between UI elements to minimize accidental 
clicks and enhance ease of interaction.

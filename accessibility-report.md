## Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our program supports equitable use by providing modern and 
simplified GUI that is easy to is easy to understand for all users, 
regardless of their familiarity with technology.  The design provides the same 
interface and functionality for everyone. interface and functionality 
for everyone. Future enhancements, such as language and unit change options 
and a dark/light theme mode, could further expand accessibility and appeal to 
an even broader audience.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Our program allows users to interact at their own pace with no time-sensitive 
inputs. Input fields, like those in the Checker feature, are simple text boxes for 
ease of use. To enhance accessibility, we could add text-to-speech functionality or 
compatibility with braille devices, ensuring inclusivity for users with disabilities.


## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Our program allows users to interact at their own pace with no time-sensitive inputs. 
Input fields, like those in the Checker feature, are simple text boxes for ease of use. 
In the future, we would like to implement more accuracy and precision by adding drop-down 
menus and selection boxes to features such as selecting a city.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information
This principle focuses on an accessible UI to all users that conveys all necessary 
information regardless of the user’s limitations. One of our program’s strengths is 
its “legibility,” as our GUI provides an adequate contrast between the essential 
information, allowing for easy navigation. We can also consider the following additions: 
a text-to-speech and/or speech-to-text feature, a tutorial or navigation feature, 
and to add more images and/or maps.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Common input errors, such as entering an invalid or empty location, 
are handled gracefully with clear error messages, ensuring users understand 
what went wrong and how to fix it. We implemented 
fail-safe features by testing edge cases and anticipating potential 
pitfalls. The design avoids potentially harmful actions 
by preventing invalid data submission entirely.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Our program’s concise interface ensures smooth navigation 
with minimal effort. Features like saved locations in the history 
section allow users to revisit previous searches without retyping. 
To enhance accessibility, we could add voice commands for weather updates or eye-tracking 
technology for effortless interaction.


## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program adheres to the principle of Size and Space 
for Approach and Use by selecting a font style and size that 
ensure readability, making it accessible to users with varying 
levels of vision or experience. Furthermore, the interface incorporates 
sufficient spacing between UI elements to minimize accidental 
clicks and enhance ease of interaction.


## Target Audience
Our weather application would be marketed towards a wide 
range of users, particularly travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, 
and commuters, who need accurate and timely weather updates. 
The program can also be advantageous to specific groups like 
farmers, event planners, and businesses that heavily rely on weather 
forecasts in order to perform their jobs. Furthermore, the AI Summary
and localized forecasting are also useful to the average person, who 
is looking to go outside prepared for the weather. Essentially, the 
use cases are vast, ranging from benefitting recreational activities,
such as by providing real-time weather conditions to bikers and 
hikers, to curating business models, for example, by assisting 
farmers’ agricultural production through detailed precipitation 
and temperature reports. By offering localized and user-specific 
program features, our weather application caters to all 
individuals seeking a tailored weather experience.

## Program Accessibility for Demographics
Our program may be less likely to be used by individuals who 
are not reliant on precise weather data or do not frequently go 
outside. For example, those living in climates with stable weather 
patterns may not find the weather application as valuable. 
Furthermore, people with mobility impairments that restrict the time 
they can spend outside may also not use the program as actively. 
While our weather application is catered to a vast amount of 
individuals with varying demographics, it is understandable that some 
groups either may not 
need or find our services as useful.

After entering the location, selecting the desired condition, and specifying the time range, she presses the "Check" button. The app then displays a dialog box confirming whether the condition will occur during the specified period. **[Chika]**

* Anna wants to know if her outfit is suitable for today’s weather. She takes a photo of herself and/or provides a brief description of her outfit and submits it through the app. OpenAI analyzes her outfit and suggests that she wears a sweater because the weather is chilly, and sunglasses for the bright sun. Anna can also view alternative outfit suggestions based on the forecast. **[Kush]**

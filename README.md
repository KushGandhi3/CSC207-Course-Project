* Anna wishes to receive updates exclusively when specific weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure, weather state, etc.) occur in her area. She can specify both the specific conditions she wants to be alerted about and the time period in advance for which she wants the alert to be set. If these trigger conditions are met, the service will generate an alert for Anna. **[Chika]**

* Anna wants to view the weather map with various layers, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and pressure, allowing her to monitor the current, forecast, and historical weather conditions in a visual format. **[Jannate]**
  
* Anna wants to know if her outfit is suitable for today’s weather. She takes a photo of herself and/or provides a brief description of her outfit and submits it through the app. OpenAI analyzes her outfit and suggests that she wears a sweater because the weather is chilly, and sunglasses for the bright sun. Anna can also view alternative outfit suggestions based on the forecast. **[Kush]**
